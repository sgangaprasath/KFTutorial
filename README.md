# Revisiting linear filtering, the Bayesian paradigm \& optimal state estimation

This folder contains the `python` code that goes along with the article in this link.
`KFTutorial.ipynb` is a jupyter-notebook to simulate 4 problems:
<ol>
  <li>Least-squares fit/estimation of a time-series data</li>
  <li>Recursive least-square estimator </li>
  <li>A simple 1-dimensional stochastic differential equation</li>
  <li>Using Kalman-Bucy filter to estimate the position of a Brownian particle in a harmonic potential</li>
</ol>

The folder also contains the LaTeX-sources files and figures of the article.
This work was done in collaboration with [Vishaal Krishnan](https://vishaal-krishnan.github.io).
